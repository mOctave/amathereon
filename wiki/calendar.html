		<h1>Calendar</h1>

		<p>Amathereon takes 296 days to orbit its sun. For this reason, it does not have a calendar that is similar to Earth's. Instead, the common calendar on Amathereon has eight months of 37 days each. The months start at the summer solstice, and have names representative of the weather during that time. The months are, in order: Heatrise, Harvestgold, Treefall, Waterlength, Icefall, Newthaw, Leafbloom, and Longingday. Months are divided into two halves of 18 days, the New and the Old, with a Middleday in between. This means that the 21th day of the second month after the summer solstice is the "Second of the Old, Harvestgold," for example.</p>
