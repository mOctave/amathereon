		<p>"Barbarian" is perhaps too crude a name for an entire category of people. Many barbarians do not match the stereotypical barbarian at all, but have their own cultures and traditions that are no less valuable than anyone else's, if others bothered to learn about them. Barbarians tend to be strong fighters, and most deeply value their honour.</p>

		<p>The few barbarians that go to live in cities often end up lost, both physically and in their spirit. Because of the distance from their own culture and the disdain for them that is so obvious in those around them, they tend to forget their traditions, and often lend themselves a bad name. Nonetheless, some barbarians manage to accomplish great things, and many become fine warriors.</p>

		<h2>Wildcraft</h2>

		<p>Barbarians receive a 50% bonus to any use of the <a href="skill.html#knowledge-wilderness">Knowledge: Wilderness</a> skill. Additionally, barbarians can choose a non-urban environment in which to gain a 20% bonus to tracking and stealth.</p>

		<h2>Calm Fury</h2>
