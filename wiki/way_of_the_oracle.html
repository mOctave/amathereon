		<p>The Way of the Oracle is an organized human religion common in Oracle Hill and the surrounding area. Followers of the Way believe in the superiority of Alaforonaist'laiezeron above any other god, but do not deny the possibility that other gods exist. The primary tenets of the Way are tolerance, respect, and diligence. Followers of the Way try to resist the end of the universe by dint of hard work, optimism, and kindness.</p>

		<p>Another major difference between the Way of the Oracle and Elvish Celestialism is that the Way teaches that Alaforonaist'laiezeron chooses men to bestow with extraordinary powers of fortelling. Historically, these Oracles have spoken great prophesies, although in recent years the prophesies have grown increasingly vague, and many suspect that the current Oracle is nothing but a fraud.</p>

		<p>Overall, the Way of the Oracle is quite tolerant as religions go, but failing to do the will of the Oracle — which is seen as the will of Alaforonaist'laiezeron — can lead to imprisonment or even, in rare cases, execution. The general laxness of the religion combined with its occasional brutality is the primary reason that it has never had a large following, and recent corruption among the Way's officials has contributed to a decline in its number of believers.</p>
