		<p>Alaforonaist'laiezeron, known as Tuzandunzat among the dwarves, is chief among all the Celestials, and is credited by many to be the Creator of the universe. He rarely interferes with the world directly, as the last time he did so ended in Arakan'ailzerun falling to the Curse, as have all Celestials who have tried to walk the world since the Rift.</p>

		<p>Alaforonaist'laiezeron occasionally communicates with the world through the dreams of one of the elves in a position of power among the Eresi, or with the Oracle, although he has become increasingly frustrated with both groups' priority on politics lately, and the widespread corruption in the ranks of both parties, so he has not spoken to the Eseri in ten years and the Oracle in fifty.</p>
