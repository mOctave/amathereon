		<p>Paladins are holy warriors, dedicated to furthering their god's kingdom on Amathereon. Paladins often hold positions in the command structure of the private armies of religious organizations, while others serve as eyes and ears or diplomats. Each paladin has their own unique specialties and personalities â€” some are charismatic while others are withdrawn, some are hardened while others still care deeply about the world.</p>

		<p>While young paladins tend to go charging off without thinking, many older paladins are very cautious and skilled tacticians. This is perhaps because they are the paladins who survived the "young paladin" stage, but they are nonetheless formidable enemies. Some of these paladins drift from their ideals, and turn to serve Chaos or their own ambition. These dark paladins tend to be despicable, although some are still very pleasant people in their own right.</p>

		<h2>Divination</h2>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Warriors gain a +1 bonus to strength and resilience.</p>
