		<p>While thieves steal material wealth and try to get rich, spies steal information, using it for their own use or selling it to others. A skilled spy can remain undetected for decades, passing valuable knowledge to their sponsors in high places, and ready to vanish at a moment's notice. Spies can be stealthy when necessary, but also know when to hide in plain sight instead. An experience spy trusts in nothing, but remains patient in the hopes that some important tidbit of information will come their way if they don't upset the situation â€” along with a generous bonus from their employer, of course.</p>

		<h2>Shadowy Connections</h2>

		<p>Spies, like all Rogues, always have connections with the criminal underworld. As such, other people of low repute tend to trust them, and will give them information or even aid in exchange for enough gold.</p>

		<h2>Stealth Expert</h2>

		<p>Spies are used to sneaking around, and receive a double agility bonus to stealth.</p>

		<h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>

		<p>Spies learn how to speak Thieves' Cant, and can often write it phonetically using the Common or Elvish character set.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Rogues gain a +1 bonus to dexterity and charisma.</p>

		<p>Spies gain an additional +1 bonus to agility.</p>
