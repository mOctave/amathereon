		<h1>The Rift</h1>

		<p>The Rift is a term for an event about three thousand years in the past that resulted in a fundemental division of order and chaos in the world and led to a number of consequences, some of which were certainly negative, but some of which can be considered positive. Some of these results included around half of all sentient species becoming Cursed, the emergence of a common tongue among all peoples, and the invention of the concept of currency.</p>

		<h2>Attitudes Toward the Rift</h2>

		<p>It is unknown what caused the Rift, but that hasn't stopped many people from speculating, and these speculations have worked their way into the heart of races' cultures until they now accept their stories as the truth.</p>

		<p>Many humans see the Rift as an event of religious warfare between the forces of good and evil, where the evil triumphed but was exposed before the whole world. Others, especially the non-religious, see it as a mythological element that may have really been some natural disaster blown out of proportion. Similarly to humans, dwarves have worked the story of the Rift into their religion, Kazan'zaram. They claim that the Rift occured shortly after the Creation, and is the reason why Tuzandunzat has been so careful not to intervene since.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, elves believe that the Rift was caused by sentient beings, specifically experiments that the giants conducted regarding the plane of Entropy. they claim that these experiments went far enough that the giants accidentally tugged the plane of Entropy into the plane of Reality, and that in doing so they doomed the universe to destruction. The giants deny any sort of experiment ever taking place.</p>

		<p>Half-elves are generally skeptical of the existence of the Rift at all, and many deny it, claiming that it is just a story for children and an excuse for evil behaviour.</p>

		<p>The Celestials may know what caused the Rift, but they have not seen fit to share this information with anyone.</p>
