		<p>Clerics are the holiest of all mages. As such, they often despise others of their kind, especially necromancers who they often denounce, claiming that their customs are abominable. Interestingly, however, they are more closely related to necromancers than they are to any other kind of mage. Both use a connection with the plane of Entropy to call upon a higher power. For clerics, the power they call upon is that of their god, typically a Celestial. When their prayers are accepted, they can receive for a short while incredible power, without having to draw any strength from themselves to do so. When their prayers are ignored, they can achieve nothing but some minor healing.</p>

		<h2>Divination</h2>
