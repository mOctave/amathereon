		<p>Rangers are wanderers of the sort that tend to make it into ballads unwillingly. A ranger is generally calm and confident, but not particularly social. Rangers guard against Chaos where soldiers never go, but they are still feared, for few ever see them but everyone knows of their existence.</p>

		<p>Most rangers are uncomfortable being in the spotlight. They seek to accomplish their goals — normally preventing Chaos from destroying civilization — while avoiding being acclaimed for it. Rangers chose to spend their lives away from other people for a reason, and they rarely willingly return. A ranger who turns to Chaos will never be a lord, but they might be a spymaster or military commader instead.</p>
