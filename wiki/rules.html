		<h1>Rules</h1>

		<p>Before playing Amathereon, you should be aware of some rules:</p>
		<p><b>Ownership:</b> Your accounts are your accounts. Your characters are your characters. Don't sell people any of your stuff for real money, that's not what the game is about. If someone offers to sell you something, report it.</p>
		<p><b>Automation and Multiple Characters:</b> Only play with one character at a time. Don't automate your characters' actions. This is supposed to be a game for people, not robots. You can have your characters leave items for each other, but you shouldn't create characters that only exist to stash items for your main character.</p>
		<p><b>Golden Rule:</b> Treat others how you want to be treated. This means no harassment, offensive or provokative language, repeatedly quitting during combat when you're about to be killed, references to sex, drugs, or other mature topics, or going around killing people for no reason.</p>
		<p><b>Exploitation:</b> If you think you've found a bug, please don't exploit it. Report it instead.</p>
		<p><b>Spoilers:</b> Don't share spoilers, please.</p>
