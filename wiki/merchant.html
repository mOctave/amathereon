		<p>There are merchants almost everywhere, and they tend to be much the same wherever you go. A merchant cares first and foremost for their profits, but secondly for their reputation, and only third for their personal life. A skilled merchant can sell you the air you breathe or the coat you wear without it seeming out of the ordinary to you.</p>

		<p>Although merchants tend to all be focused on making the gold in their pockets jingle the loudest — typically by increasing its volume — how they go about it depends on the person. Some prioritize their reputation for quality, selling only the best and charging a premium. Others only care about how much they can sell: their quality tends to be very poor, but their prices are also cheaper and they rarely choose to haggle over them.</p>

		<h2>Haggling</h2>

		<p>Merchants receive 5% off all purchases, and +5% to all profits from sales.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Merchants gain a +1 bonus to constitution, wisdom, and charisma.</p>
