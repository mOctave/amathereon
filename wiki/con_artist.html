		<p>Con artists walk the streets of just about every city on Amathereon, trying to trick unwary tourists into losing their hard-earned, easily spent gold. These crafty criminals almost never get caught: their plans are well-laid and no one realizes that something has gone wrong at first. In many ways, they are like merchants: they can convince someone to buy a glass "diamond," and, when the disgruntled customer comes back demanding a refund, they'll find a way to avoid giving it to them, likely by being in the next town already.</p>

		<h2>Shadowy Connections</h2>

		<p>Con artists, like all Rogues, always have connections with the criminal underworld. As such, other people of low repute tend to trust them, and will give them information or even aid in exchange for enough gold.</p>

		<h2>Interpersonal Skills</h2>

		<p>Con artists receive +20% effect to uses of <a href="skills.html#mental-deception">Mental: Deception</a>, <a href="skills.html#mental-intimdation">Mental: Intimidation</a>, <a href="skills.html#mental-performance">Mental: Performance</a>, and <a href="skills.html#mental-persuasion">Mental: Persuasion</a>.</p>

		<h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>

		<p>Con artists learn how to speak Thieves' Cant, and can usually write it phonetically using the Common character set.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Rogues gain a +1 bonus to dexterity and charisma.</p>

		<p>Con artists gain an additional +1 bonus to charisma, for a total of +2.</p>
