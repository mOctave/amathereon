		<h1>Character Classes</h1>

		<p>In Amathereon, classes are divided into two levels: wide classes, and narrow classes. Your character's wide class represents where they've come from and what general kind of adventurer they are, whether they are a criminal, fighter, wanderer, magic user, or something that doesn't fit nicely into one of these categories. Narrow classes are much more specific: they have a much larger effect on your character's stats than its wide class does.</p>

		<p>There are six wide classes accessible by the player. One of them, the Citizen class, is used for characters that do not have any other class defined.</p>
