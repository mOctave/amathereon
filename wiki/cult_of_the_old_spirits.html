		<p>The Cult of the Old Spirits is a very strange religion. Its followers are surprisingly plentiful for a cult, in part because it is generally tolerant and does not impose any difficult burden on the Cultists. At the core of the Cult's beliefs is that if the non-existence of God, however that does not stop them from worshipping the myriad spirits they see at work in the world around them as they see fit. The Cult is heavily influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandeism">pandeism</a>, believing that there may have been some creator who, in creating the universe, was sucked into it and became the souls of all living beings, especially prominent in the Celestials. They argue that <a href="alaforonaist'laiezeron.html">Alaforonaist'laiezeron</a> then took credit for the creation of the world, and that the Celestials supported him to gain power for themselves.</p>

		<p>Nonetheless, they acknowledge the Celestials' power, perhaps afraid that if they do not, the Celestials will destroy them. This aspect of the Cult, more than any other, shows how closely bound they are to traditional human folk religions.</p>

		<p>The Cult of the Old Spirits is popular in Chisterke and the Second Department of Uruthl, where follow their own religions rather than <a href="shadow_worship.html">Shadow Worship</a>.</p>
