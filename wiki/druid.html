		<p>Druids understand the wilderness like nobody else. A skilled druid can even, with this knowledge, control the weather, and even an unskilled druid can be a great healer or hunter. Most druids live in isolation: if somebody seeks the help of a druid, they must first find them. However, druids do occasionally meet to discuss matters of importance.</p>

		<p>A druid is considered responsible for a patch of land, usually about 5 wapentake. They see to the health of the land and the people and animals who live on it. This is a druid's goal in life, to ensure that everything else can run smoothly. Few druids turn to Chaos, and those who do are usually executed by their own, although those who remain hidden can become exceptionally dangerous</p>

		<h2>Wildcraft</h2>

		<p>Druids receive a 50% bonus to any use of the <a href="skill.html#knowledge-wilderness">Knowledge: Wilderness</a> skill. Additionally, druids can choose a non-urban environment in which to gain a 20% bonus to tracking and stealth.</p>
