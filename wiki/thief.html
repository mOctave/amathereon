		<p>Some blame the Rift for creating thieves. This is not true. There have always been thieves, and there always will be: theft is the third profession to ever exist, and it is just as disreputable as the first two, if not more so. Although theft is plainly illegal, and punisments vary from fines to inprisonment to execution depending on the country in which the thief is caught, many thieves do have their own moral code.</p>

		<p>In general, only the smartest thieves manage to last very long, especially in places like Omnipolis. Thieves that become adventurers tend to do so because of trouble with the law, and are usually suspected of minor crimes. Most thieves avoid killing unless it is necessary, and do not kill someone who means them no harm. Instead, thieves manage to amass wealth through less violent means, and often use it to build a network of informents who will help them out if they ever get caught.</p>

		<h2>Shadowy Connections</h2>

		<p>Thieves, like all Rogues, always have connections with the criminal underworld. As such, other people of low repute tend to trust them, and will give them information or even aid in exchange for enough gold.</p>

		<h2>Stealth Expert</h2>

		<p>Thieves are used to sneaking around, and receive a double agility bonus to stealth.</p>

		<h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>

		<p>Thieves learn how to speak Thieves' Cant, and can often write it phonetically using the Common character set.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Rogues gain a +1 bonus to dexterity and charisma.</p>

		<p>Thieves gain an additional +1 bonus to intelligence.</p>
