		<h1>Skills</h1>

		<p>Skills are a core aspect of Amathereon. They allow you to be better at specific areas, providing more precision than ability scores. Skills are divided into four sections: Knowledge, Mental, Physical and Weapons. Knowledge skills let you know more about a specific kind of thing: if you want to get information about a tool used in magic, you will be more likely to recall the information quickly if you have a high level in Knowledge: Arcana. Mental skills improve how you interact with others and the world around you: what you can notice, think of doing, and make people feel. For example, Mental: Deception makes you a better liar. Physical skills let you use your body better: you are less likely to trip if you have a high level for Physical: Acrobatics. Finally, Weapons skills give you bonuses to using weapons of specific types. If you're using a bow, you'll get bonuses out of the Weapons skill, as well as Weapons: Ranged and Weapons: Piercing.</p>
