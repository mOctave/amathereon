		<p>Artificers built the gadgets that others use, and, in time, take for granted. They tend to have a wide variety of knowledge about technology, being skilled engineers and capable in several trades. A skilled artificer can build almost anything given a blueprint and enough time and money, and the best can invent and design their own wonders.</p>

		<p>Even a relatively unskilled artificer can be useful to have around. For artificers, fixing things becomes second nature, and any artificer can repair almost anything, especially highly technical pieces that would otherwise be almost impossible to get working again.</p>

		<p>Most artificers live generally reclusive lives, working away at whatever people will pay them to do, while completing their own projects on the side. Some, however, live a more public life, becoming famous for their inventions or using them to accomplish something greater.</p>

		<h2>Repairs</h2>

		<p>Given enough time, an artificer can repair any damaged piece of equipment.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Artificers gain a +1 bonus to dexterity, strength, and intelligence.</p>
