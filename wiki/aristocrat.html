		<p>Everyone wants to trust an aristocrat, but few truly do. Most of the nobility are haughty and selfish wherever you go, but many are also shrewd politicans, skilled at manipulating people to do as they wish. Additionally, while aristocrats rarely have any marketable skills, they do have money, which is itself the means of gaining more. Many try to seek the patronage of a noble, and this gives them great power, to use as they will.</p>
