		<p>The Faith of Ratawanda is an orginized polythiestic religion common on the eastern half of the plains, and what passes for government in Hatia. Ratawandans worship a wide variety of gods, foremost among them being Ratawanda, who they see as warden over all of Earth and the first among equals among the gods. Even the most learned scholars are uncertain whether or not the Faith derived from early forms of Celestial worship, or whether it only has its roots in human folk religions.</p>

		<p>The Faith of Ratawanda is very sophisticated for a polytheistic religion. Followers are held to a strict code of ethics that does not apply in any way to unbelievers. The high priests regularly call for mass sacrifices, although much of the sacrificed material is used to feed the hungry afterwards.</p>
