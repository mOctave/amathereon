		<p>Assassins are hated by almost all, yet they continue to find work all over Amathereon. Unlike thieves, assassins often manage to live long enough the amass quite a bit of wealth, but this is only because they can earn much more in a fixed amount of time if everything goes well. Assassins have nimble fingers and fast-working brains, and can be quite useful in a pinch.</p>

		<p>It is widely believed that assassins have no moral code. This is not true: an assassin will kill anybody, but only if there is some obvious benefit to them doing so. Because nobles have other ways of desposing of peasants, they only hire assassins to deal with someone of a similar level of wealth to them in most cases, and so assassins generally are tasked with killing potential employers.</p>

		<h2>Shadowy Connections</h2>

		<p>Assassins, like all Rogues, always have connections with the criminal underworld. As such, other people of low repute tend to trust them, and will give them information or even aid in exchange for enough gold.</p>

		<h2>Killing Blow</h2>

		<p>Assassins are proficient in killing people quickly, and receive double the critical chance of others.</p>

		<h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>

		<p>Assassins learn how to speak Thieves' Cant, and can usually write it phonetically using the Common character set.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Rogues gain a +1 bonus to dexterity and charisma.</p>

		<p>Assassins gain an additional +1 bonus to dexterity, for a total of +2.</p>
