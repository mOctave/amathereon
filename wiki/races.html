		<p>While there are many races on Amathereon, most of them are only semi-sentient, or very rare. Only sixteen are worth serious mention and can be selected by the player, eight of which belong to the Cursed. Most of these have populations greater than a hundred thousand, although no one knows how many pixies exist, except for maybe the highest members of the pixies government. Exceptions are made for those Cursed races that have too great of an impact on the world to be ignored: vampires, dragonking, magar, the Fallen, and wyrms.</p>

		<p>A player can create a character belonging to any race, although they can only have one wyrm linked to their account.</p>

		<p>Choosing a race has a significant effect on your character's languages and ability bonuses, and it is important for players who plan to roleplay heavily to read up on their chosen race.</p>
		
		<!--Humans-->
		<hr/>

		<h2 id="human">Humans</h2>

		<p>Humans are the most widespread race on Amathereon, due to their versatility and fast reproductive rate. Most nations are primarily governed by humans, and most cultures are very heavily human-influenced, with the sole exceptions being the Tunnel culture and Eseri Elfish. Humans are special as they receive bonuses to all their ability scores, and so they are the easiest for new players.</p>

		<p>Humans tend to make everything more complicated. Human customs vary widely across Amathereon, and so what may be commonplace on one side of the continent could be considered outrageous on the other. In general, humans like organization, and create large groups which are dedicated to filing paperwork and completing simple tasks in complicated ways. At the same time, however, many humans try to flee from this obsesive organzation.</p>

		<h3>Location</h3>

		<p>Humans can be found all over Amathereon, in every city except for Cyhenorran and the Under Cities.</p>

		<h3>Languages</h3>

		<p>Humans speak Common, and most can also read and write in it using the standard characters. Additionally, some humans may speak a local dialect, although this is a purely optional choice for heavy role-players and not enforced by game mechanics.</p>

		<h3>Names</h3>

		<p>A human's name depends on where they come from, due to cultural variation. In the south, human names are similar to traditional English names, although on the plains humans have much greater variety in names. Hatian names tend to be reminiscent of Middle Eastern nomenclature.</p>

		<h3>Specials</h3>

			<p>Few humans are exceptional in any given area without a lot of practice, however most are capable of doing a fair bit of anything. The specials humans receive reflect this: rather than a boost to a specific area, humans get small bonuses across the board.</p>

			<h4>Versatility</h4>

			<p>Humans can select two skills to gain a level in upon character creation.</p>

		<!--Halflings-->
		<hr/>
	
		<h2 id="halfling">Halflings</h2>
	
		<p>Halflings are in many ways similar to humans, albeit smaller. Centuries of conflict have left them stubborn and strong-willed, but if you don't do anything to get on their bad side they are often hospitable, and they generally live comfortable, relaxed lives. They have slower metabolisms than humans, and need less food, and so can enjoy a higher quality of life for equal wages.</p>

		<p>Halflings are often good at supporting other races, because they are not easily trapped or bewitched. However, halflings have also fought successfully by themselves: they held Kirford for three days against the Urunki and Magar in the War of the Shadow before the Shomyards arrived. In recent times, however, halflings have been mostly forgotten, and they are content to live that way rather than face war.</p>

		<h3>Location</h3>
	
		<p>Halflings are found primarily in Omnipolis and the states south of the Grey Mountains, although they can occasionally be found almost anywhere but Uruthl and the Under Cities.</p>
	
		<h3>Languages</h3>
	
		<p>Halflings speak Common, and most can also read and write in it using the standard characters. Although halflings once had their own language, few remember it at all anymore, as it fell into disuse shortly after the Rift.</p>
	
		<h3>Names</h3>
	
		<p>A halfling's name is generally similar to Germanic and English nomenclature, although last names are normally descriptions of the family's traditional home. Examples include: Wideriver, Steephills, Underock, Greenvalley, and Woodenhouse.</p>
	
		<h3>Specials</h3>
	
			<p>Halflings are often used to a life of relative luxury, however they can be skilled warriors or hunters if they need to be. Although halflings have a variety of skills, their most notable skills are </p>
	
			<h4>Indomitable</h4>
	
			<p>Halflings are stubborn and cannot be easily cowed. Intimidating them or breaking their spirit is very difficult to do, and they are not susceptible to any magical attacks on their soul.</p>

			<h4>Versatility</h4>
	
			<p>Halflings can select two skills to gain a level in upon character creation.</p>

		<!--Dwarves-->
		<hr/>
		
		<h2 id="dwarf">Dwarves</h2>
		
		<p>Dwarves are a short, strong folk who spend most of their time working with metal and stone and drinking whatever alcohol they can get their hands on. They have a rugged constitution, and do not get intoxicated, although they are occasionally driven mad in pursuit of a new metal that is said to have near-magical properties.</p>
	
		<h3>Location</h3>
		
		<p>Dwarves are found primarily in Thaxningdon and the Under Cities, although there is a sizeable portion of them living in Omnipolis and they can be found occasionally almost anywhere.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		
		<p>Dwarves speak Common, Dwarvish and Underspeak. Most dwarves can read and write in Common and Dwarvish using dwarvish characters.</p>
		
		<h3>Names</h3>
		
		<p>Dwarvish names can best be described as the sound of grating stone with a couple of As and Os tossed in for good measure. Dwarves use similar names for places and people. Examples of dwarvish names include: Zhandar, Zylar, Tuzadus, Galedzah, Umun, Zilamunz, and Kurth.</p>
		
		<h3>Specials</h3>
		
			<p>Dwarves are very skilled in working with the earth, but it is not unknown for dwarves to abandon a life of blacksmithing, mining, and masonry for other work.</p>
	
			<h4>Rock Lore</h4>
		
			<p>Dwarves are familiar with most kinds of rock and metal. They can tell on sight what kind of rock something is, and if it has recently been put under strain.</p>
	
			<h4>Versatility</h4>
		
			<p>Dwarves can select two skills to gain a level in upon character creation.</p>

		<!--Elves-->
		<hr/>
		
		<h2 id="elf">Elves</h2>
		
		<p>Elves became sentient long before any of the other races except the giants and celestials. An ancient and rich oral tradition has led to them having a deep, shared respect and appreciation of nature. Elves spend a lot of time taking care of the world around them, trying to bring order to an increasingly chaotic world while still maintaining the beauty of the chaos.</p>

		<p>Elves fought amongst each other long ago, but since then they have lived peacefully together, albeit in three distinct cultural groups. The first, the Eseri culture, enforces isolation from humans wherever possible. This group, some 500 thousand strong is centred in Cyhenorran, the fabled City of the Elves. Here, they allow none but elves, gnomes, and halflings to live. Eseri elves can also be found in the surrounding countryside, and as far south as Rynead.</p>

		<p>The second sect of elves are the Aqinaé, or Sea-Elves. These are very rare on the continent of Amathereon, but can be found on distant islands and occasionally appear along the coast to trade. They are far outnumbered by the last group of elves, the Serian. The Serian live in small clans across the plains, and a sizeable presence of them (about 80 thousand) live in Omnipolis. Although it is rumoured that some of the Serian also serve Uruthl, these are likely half-elves.</p>

		<p>Elves can live for several hundred years, so it is little surprise that they are distrusted by humans. Some have even gone so far as to accuse them of practicing eugenics in the form of pedicide. While this is certainly a potential explanation for their unnaturally long lifespans, it is far more plausible that their magical blood is the only cause for their longevity.</p>
	
		<h3>Location</h3>
		
		<p>Elves can be found scattered across the Union of Narius and the plains, in Omnipolis, and occasionally in ports along the south coast of Amathereon.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		
		<p>Elves speak Common, Elvish and Druidic. Most elves are well-educated and can read and write in Common and Elvish using the glyhps of both languages.</p>
		
		<h3>Names</h3>
		
		<p>Elvish names tend to be flowing and reminiscent of nature. Examples include Linlean, Mathenil, Yselieriar, Aethyr, Veltalas, Alvemel, and Ayinoran.</p>
		
		<h3>Specials</h3>
		
			<p>Elves are perhaps the most magical of all races. This is reflected in their special abilities.</p>
	
			<h4>Elvish Blood</h4>
		
			<p>Magic is strong in the blood of elves. They live for a very long time, and do not often fall ill. A vampire that attempts to drink the blood of an elf will be poisoned and die in less than a minute.</p>
	
			<h4>Darkvision</h4>
		
			<p>Elves can see in the dark far better than members of most races. They are able to make out dim shapes in pitch-blackness, and see in dim light as if it were day.</p>

		<!--Half-Elves-->
		<hr/>
		
		<h2 id="half-elf">Half-Elves</h2>
		
		<p>Over the centuries, elves and humans have interbred to the point where an entirely new race has been created. Half-elves half many of the traits of humans, but many of the traits of elves. They are distrusted by both groups, and the Eseri have banned the from Cyhenorran. For this reason, they are often harsh and distrustful of others, and many serve Uruthl rather than face discrimination elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Most half-elves are descendents of the Serian, although Eseri half-elves are not uncommon and there are a couple groups that trace their lineage back to the Aqinaé. Half-elves are proud of their lineage, because, although others despise them for it, it is the only thing which ties them together as a race.</p>
	
		<h3>Location</h3>
		
		<p>Half-elves can be found all over Amathereon, in every city except Cyhenorran and the Under Cities. They are especially common on the plains, in Omnipolis, and in Uruthl.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		
		<p>Half-elves speak Common and Elvish. Many can read and write in Common and Elvish using the glyhps of both languages.</p>
		
		<h3>Names</h3>
		
		<p>Half-elves are known to take both elvish and human names, sometimes having multiple names. In general, a half-elf with multiple names will be called by their Common name first, so A'nan Aeriel instead of Aeriel A'nan.</p>
		
		<h3>Specials</h3>
		
			<p>Half-elves are a mix of humans and elves in almost every respect.</p>
	
			<h4>Elvish Blood</h4>
		
			<p>Although half-elves have only some elvish blood, they still tend to live for a couple of centuries, and are only rarely sick. As with elves, a vampire that attempts to drink the blood of a half-elf will be poisoned and die in less than a minute.</p>

		<!--Urunki-->
		<hr/>
		
		<h2 id="urunk">Urunki</h2>
		
		<p>Although urunki do not belong to the Cursed, they tend to be semi-sentient. Urunki adventurers are rare, since it is rare for an urunk to be able to outwit any member of the other sentient races. Urunki instead tend to serve Uruthl, as they are expert warriors and tend to be aggresive and this service lets them use those skills. The few that do not are constantly wary of people who are smarter than them, as many try to trick urunki into doing what they want.</p>

		<p>Additionally, urunki can be bound by one of the Fallen or a Wyrm to follow their instructions and worship them as a god, although players' characters are mostly immune to this.</p>
	
		<h3>Location</h3>
		
		<p>Urunki can be found all over Amathereon, in every city except Cyhenorran and the Under Cities, but they are rare outside of Omnipolis and Uruthl.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		
		<p>Urunki speak Common and Uruthk. Few Urunki can write, but most can read Common and Uruthk using the characters of either language.</p>
		
		<h3>Names</h3>
		
		<p>Urunki names tend to be made of two parts: an individual name, and a clan name. Urunki names sound roughly like large rocks scraping together when spoken: they tend to be only one or two syllables and contain a lot of consonants.</p>
		
		<h3>Specials</h3>
		
			<p>Urunki are expert fighters and trackers.</p>
	
			<h4>Attunement</h4>
		
			<p>An urunk can attune themselves to someone they seek to track, if they have a piece of that person — whether it be blood, hair, or even dead skin from the inside of their cloak. While they are attuned, they know exactly where that person is, and feel an overwhelming desire to hunt them down.</p>
	
			<h4>Tough Skin</h4>
		
			<p>An urunk receives a +1 bonus to protection and resistance against non-magical weapons.</p>

		<!--Gnomes-->
		<hr/>
		
		<h2 id="gnome">Gnomes</h2>
		
		<p>Gnomes are some of the strangest creatures on Amathereon. Although they can fly, they often spend their entire lives underground, working with metal and crystals in the Under Cities. Gnomes thirst for variety, but they are attracted even more to the forge: they yearn to be with metal and to make something out of it.</p>

		<p>Gnomes commonly work with dwarves, but even the dwarves do not understand them. Gnomes are long-lived and often find themselves drawn to a life of adventure, but such adventures as they have do not normally occur outside of the Under Cities, and, in rare cases, Omnipolis.</p>
	
		<h3>Location</h3>
		
		<p>Gnomes can be found in the Under Cities, and, occasionally, in Thaxningdon and Omnipolis.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		
		<p>Gnomes speak Common and Underspeak, and can usually read and write in both in Common and Dwarvish glyphs.</p>
		
		<h3>Names</h3>
		
		<p>Gnomes have incredibly long names. It is said that each time they meet someone for the first time they add that person's name to their own. For this reason, Gnomes often choose dwarf or goblin nicknames.</p>
		
		<h3>Specials</h3>
		
			<p>Gnomes are, in many ways, very similar to dwarves, despite their many differences.</p>
	
			<h4>Flight</h4>
		
			<p>A gnome can fly as fast as they can walk. Gnomes can fly straight up or down between rooms even if it would normally be impossible to do so, and they can use their powers of flight to gain +1 to attempts to dodge attacks.</p>
	
			<h4>Rock Lore</h4>
		
			<p>Gnomes are familiar with most kinds of rock and metal. They can tell on sight what kind of rock something is, and if it has recently been put under strain.</p>

		<!--Goblins-->
		<hr/>
		
		<h2 id="goblin">Goblins</h2>
		
		<p>Goblins are the most common of all non-humans, but they rarely are seen in the light of day outside Omnipolis. Instead, millions of goblins live underground, all across the Under Cities. They maintain sewers, tunnels, and mines, and keep the world running smoothly by eating any pests they come upon. Goblins do not have a sense of taste — they will eat absolutely anything that they can chew and get only mild pleasure from the experience. As a result, goblins often die of food poisoning, although they <i>can</i> ingest many toxic substances with no result other than flatulence.</p>

		<p>Most denizens of the overworld find goblins repulsive, but goblins are nonetheless very capable. It is said that goblins are the only race on whom the Curse fell that managed to fight it off and survive: an unkind overworlder may, at this point, remark that even the Curse couldn't stand their smell.</p>
	
		<h3>Location</h3>
		
		<p>Goblins can be found all over the Under Cities, in other places underground, and in Omnipolis.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		
		<p>Goblins speak Common and Underspeak, and can usually read and write in both using the Common characters.</p>
		
		<h3>Names</h3>
		
		<p>Goblins like to name themselves after a memorable experience from their childhood. Due to the high child mortality rate among goblins, they only choose this name when they turn eight years old and come of age.</p>
		
		<h3>Specials</h3>
		
			<p>Although many despise goblins, they are nonetheless unique.</p>
	
			<h4>Darkvision</h4>
		
			<p>Goblins can see in the dark far better than members of most races. They are able to make out dim shapes in pitch-blackness, and see in dim light as if it were day.</p>
	
			<h4>Attunement</h4>
		
			<p>A goblin can attune themselves to someone they seek to track, if they have a piece of that person — whether it be blood, hair, or even dead skin from the inside of their cloak. While they are attuned, they know exactly where that person is, and feel an overwhelming desire to hunt them down.</p>
