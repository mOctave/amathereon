		<p>Arakan'ailzerun was the most promising of all the Celestials under Alaforonaist'laiezeron's command at the time of the Rift. He was, in many ways, the kind of person that plays the role of the hero in children's tales: brave, courteous, and with a strong conscience. When Alaforonaist'laiezeron first heard of the rebellion of some of the Celestials — who would later become known as the Fallen — he sent Arakan'ailzerun, along with four of his close friends, to investigate and to take the necessary steps to protect the world from the Fallen's rebellion. At first, Arakan'ailzerun met with success. He quickly deduced that the Fallen had not chosen to turn to Chaos of their own accord, but had been Cursed, and he reccomended that all other Celestials on the plane of Reality return to Entropy as soon as possible.</p>

		<p>After making these reccomendations, he went on to try to protect the town of Borvylu (Borevillow) from one of the Fallen, Mara'tinarel. The two met in battle, but Arakan'ailzerun was by far the stronger, and he banished Mara'tinarel from the plane of Reality entirely. However, drawing so much power from Possibility broke Arakan'ailzerun and he became one of the Fallen himself. In his last moment of sanity, he entreated his companions to kill him and cast him from Reality, but they did not wish to do him harm and so a great evil was brought into the world.</p>

		<p>After being completely lost to Chaos, Arakan'ailzerun compelled his companions to join him, breaking them to Chaos as well. Taking the name Arakh, he built for himself an army and used it to besiege Urunelle of the Seven Spires (Uruthl), which he made his capital. From there, he raised forces for himself, primarily men, half-elves, vampires, magar, urunki, and other Fallen, and used them to rebuild an empire.</p>

		<p>Lately, Arakh has begun to push the boundaries of Uruthl southwards, and his creations, wyrms, have been seen as far away as the Grey Mountains and Pemasingsia.</p>
