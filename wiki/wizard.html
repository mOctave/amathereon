		<p>Wizards are mages who spend their entire lives in pursuit of knowledge. Although many wizards are quite powerful, they often find ways to avoid using magic, using instead the knowledge they have gathered over a lifetime of study. For this reason, wizards, who draw their magic from slight differences in the planes of Reality and Perception, are not as powerful magicians as, say, sorcerers.</p>

		<p>Wizards know of slight differences between the planes of Reality and Perception, and know how to tweak one of the planes in a place where a difference is present and force the other to follow. Depending on the size of the original difference between the planes, they can create very powerful magic, or completely fail to do anything. Nonetheless, few wizards ever learn of a different way to protect themselves, instead trusting others to keep them alive until they can find a large enough difference between the planes to effect a true change on both.</p>

		<h2>Wizardcraft</h2>

		<p>Wizards can use their knowledge to cast basic spells reliably, and complex spells slowly and inefficiently.</p>

		<h2>Select Two Languages</h2>

		<p>Wizards can choose two additional languages in which they can both speak, read, and write. This language cannot be Thieves' Cant or Druidic.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Mages gain a +1 bonus to intelligence and wisdom.</p>

		<p>Wizards gain an additional +1 bonus to wisdom, for a total of +2.</p>
