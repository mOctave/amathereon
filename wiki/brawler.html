		<p>Brawlers are the masters of taproom combat. They can make a weapon out of anything, and hold their own when punches start flying. They may not be the smartest, or the best with people, in most situations, but they can be relied on to stay focused in combat and get what needs to be done, done. Brawlers often build for themselves a reputation: an experienced brawler will be known all over the city, and even law enforcement will try to avoid upsetting one. Brawlers are often involved with a criminal element, but this is not always the case, and some brawlers even devote their lives to keeping the peace.</p>

		<h2>Unarmed Combat</h2>

		<p>Brawlers receive a +3 hit bonus, a +3 parry bonus, and a +1 damage bonus in unarmed combat or while using improvised weapons.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Warriors gain a +1 bonus to strength and resilience.</p>

		<p>Brawlers gain an additional +1 bonus to strength, for a total of +2.</p>
