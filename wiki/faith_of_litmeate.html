		<p>The Faith of Litmeate is a folk religion whose followers believe that there was once a God more powerful than any Celestial who came to Amathereon and left behind a set of rules that are to be followed no matter the cost. These principals form the oldest legal code of any kind, and have been adopted by enough people that worship of Litmeate is very common among the followers of the code.</p>

		<p>The Faith has been criticized for its inability to adapt to modern times: because the rules are seen as unchangeable, many of them are considered outmoded by the majority of people on Amathereon, and many Hillrockians secretly believe that their primary religion is what is holding their nation back from taking the position it deserves on the global stage.</p>
