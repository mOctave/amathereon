		<p>There are many kinds of monk, from many kinds of religion, but almost all have some basic knowledge of how to protect themselves. In many religions, the monks guard the clerics and acolytes, leaving them free to pursue their work wherever it takes them. Many find it strange that such a large group under religious vows are still such powerful combatants, but it is perhaps not extraordinary considering that many of them were soldiers, criminals, or simple farmers before taking the vows that made them monks.</p>

		<p>Many monks develop and teach martial arts involving nothing more than their bare hands. While these arts are primarily intended as a way to improve control over one's body, they are still useful in combat situations, and have led to monks' reputations as people not to be messed with.</p>
