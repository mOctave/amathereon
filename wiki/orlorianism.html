		<p>Orlorianism is an organized religion that is famous for its militance and intolerance of unbelievers. Although it provides well for its own flock, and is not normally corrupt, it does so by placing a heavy burden on those who do not belong to the fold. In this way, Orlorians hope to unify the world under the service of Order and so please Dodble, the Worried Mother of Amathereon, who has watched humans go their own way and fears that this will lead them to Chaos and eternal damnation. Orlorianism is the most popular religion on Amathereon, being roughly as common as all the other major religions combined. It has its roots in the Orlorn Deities folk religion.</p>
