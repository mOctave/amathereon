		<p>Grireverchism is a religion whose followers believe solely in the existence of the powers of Order and Chaos as divine beings. They worship neither, but acknowledge both, and support whichever side they wish. The supreme diety of Grireverchism is the Grireverch, a council comprised mostly of humans that is split into two groups, one half supporting Order and the other half supporting Chaos. The Grireverch's word is law for Grireverchists, but because the two sides of the council have very different agendas, very little happens unless one side manages to trick the other.</p>

		<p>In the Grireverch, the representatives of Order wear long grey cloaks, while the representatives of Chaos wear many-coloured cloaks in clashing patterns. There are always five representatives from each side, and both usually go heavily armed to meetings. The average life expentency of a member of the Grireverch is six months, although one of the representatives for Order has managed to survive for twenty-three years and is still going strong.</p>
