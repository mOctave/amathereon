		<p>Necromancers often have a bad reputation among others, and not just magicians. Despite this, there is very little truth to the tales people tell of their "evil rites." Necromancers do indeed commune with the souls of the dead, but there is little mysticism to it, just a brief superimposing of a specific subset of Entropy onto Reality. It is also untrue that the souls can escape into Reality: they are bound to Entropy and will forceably be returned within a few hours from the perspective of someone experiencing Perception.</p>

		<p>Nonetheless, there certainly are some very chaotic necromancers, who embrace the stereotypes of their kind and try their best to set the souls of particular people at free in Reality once more â€” under their control, of course. Thankfully, these dark necromancers have not succeeded in accomplishing these goals, nor will they ever.</p>

		<h2>Necromancy</h2>

		<p>Necromancers can superimpose part of Entropy onto Reality, and can communicate with the souls in that section. They can also draw power from that portion of Entropy for their own magic.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Sorcerers gain an additional +1 bonus to constitution.</p>
