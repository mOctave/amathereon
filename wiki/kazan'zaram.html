		<p>Kazan'zaram, the primary religion of the dwarves, is a simple set of beliefs bound together by a strict moral code and oaths of service to Tuzandunzat if he ever calls. The tenets of Kazan'zaram are as follows:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Tuzandunzat created Amathereon to both please himself and to study how randomness could effect something organized. He also created the Celestials, whom he leads in taking notes on the experiment.</li>
			<li>When the plane of Entropy finishes rolling into the plane of Reality, the world will end: the experiment will be finished.</li>
			<li>Tuzandunzat does not interfere in his experiment, furthermore, each person should avoid interference by following his own moral compass so as to not damage the experiment.</li>
			<li>If Tuzandunzat ever requires something, faithful followers of Kazan'zaram must do as he wills.</li>
			<li>The souls of those who faithfully preserve the experiment's existence will be preserved in the plane of Entropy as room is made.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Kazan'zaram is a small religion, perhaps because its followers are not at all evangelical, but it is popular when it is rarely preached because of its scientific nature. Interestingly, the strict moral code that is embodied in Kazan'zaram is merely a suggestion: the religious leaders mete out no punishment for wrongdoing in the fear that they will ruin Tuzandunzat's experiment by doing so.</p>
