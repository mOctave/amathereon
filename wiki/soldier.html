		<p>Soldiers appear, at first glance, very ordinary and not especially skilled, but they tend to pick up many skills over the course of years of campaigning. Experienced soldiers can match even a knight in single combat, and they know both how and when to break the rules. Soldiers have been everywhere and seen everything: nothing fazes them easily, and they often have very surprising skill sets.</p>

		<p>Many distrust soldiers, because of their profession's bad reputation, but if you earn a soldier's trust they will not break it. For many, their word is all that is left to them after decades of killing, and they value it highly. For others, unfortunately, they no longer care who they harm: they will have their fun regardless of who it hurts.</p>

		<h2>Veteran</h2>

		<p>Soldiers gain weapon experience twice as fast.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Warriors gain a +1 bonus to strength and resilience.</p>

		<p>Soldiers gain an additional +1 bonus to resilience, for a total of +2.</p>
