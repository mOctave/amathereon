		<p>Sorcerers are the most powerful of all magicians on Amathereon. Drawing power from Possibility, they can accomplish almost anything that could be, no matter how unlikely. Sorcerers that serve Chaos are especially powerful, as they can use its full power to their benefit.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately for sorcerers â€” and perhaps fortunately for everyone else, there's a catch. A sorcerer can only draw so much power from the plane of Possibility before their strength of will runs out and they start drawing strength from their own bodies. Many a sorcerer has accidentally killed themself trying to achieve greatness, not realizing how close they were to the edge before they crossed it.</p>

		<p>Overall, sorcerers are more cunning than they are wise. A sorcerer can make a complicated plan, but without the input of others it is likely to fall apart. Sorcerers who live long enough <i>can</i> become quite wise, but they still are often unaware of the limits of their own strength.</p>

		<h2>Sorcery</h2>

		<p>Sorcerers can use the plane of Possibility to cast powerful magics, while drawing power from their own body.</p>
