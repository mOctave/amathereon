		<p>Bards are wandering musicians, always in search of a song that truly describes the world as they see it. Bards also are generally skilled poets, and know much about the history of Amathereon. Many bards are almost aggressively charismatic, performing for anyone who will pay them, and mocking anyone who won't. Nonetheless, a bard that calls you a friend will treat you no diferently than any other close friend would.</p>

		<p>Very few people begin their lives wanting to be bards, but it is not a bad life. Although a bard often needs someone else to defend and protect them, they can make money almost anywhere. For this reason, many bards settle down after a while and forsake the life of a travelling performer, only to take it up again when they run out of gold once more.</p>
