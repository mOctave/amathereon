		<h1>The Four Planes of Existence</h1>

		<p>The world of Amathereon is more than meets the eye. Four planes exist, which together form the world as it is, is seen, and could be.</p>

		<h2>Reality</h2>

		<p>Reality is the plane that is the most real of all the planes of Amathereon. It is never seen, but it affects all of the other planes, shaping them and binding them together. Time does not pass on the plane of Reality, and there is no soul: life cannot truly be said to exist there.</p>

		<h2>Perception</h2>

		<p>Perception is the spirit plane, on which dwell all forms of life. Perception is very closely tied to an ever-shifting subsection of Reality, although some differences are present, which can be harnessed by skilled magicians to change both planes. Most people only ever experience Perception, as that is all their souls can truly experience, although every physical object technically exists in all four planes at once. Perception is also the only plane that contains the existence of time.</p>

		<h2>Possibility</h2>

		<p>Possibility is the plane that holds everything that could possibly be, making it the largest of all the planes. It is constantly shifting to match Reality, and diverging again. Despite this, there is no time, only five dimensional space. Possibility can be reached by Travelling, and is the source of sorcerers' magic. The human soul can, with training, learn to experience Possibility in all its fullness, although long periods in this plane (and long distances travelled in any of the five dimensions) will lead to the soul's destruction as the Traveller is first snatched out of the plane of Perception, and then the plane of Reality.</p>

		<h2>Entropy</h2>

		<p>Entropy is the plane of heaven and hell. Souls, when disconnected from their bodies, experience this plain. On one side is perfect order, and on the other chaos. The chaos-filled end has been rolling into Reality since the dawn of time, and the world will end when Entropy only contains order and Reality holds nothing but chaos.</p>

		<h2>Sources of Magicians' Magic</h2>

		<p>While sorcerers harness the plane of Possibility to their own ends, wizards instead use the differences between Reality and Perception for their magics, and necromancers, paladins, and clerics all use Entropy in one way or another to commune with the Celestials or the souls of the dead. Druids, on the other hand, use only Reality, and so are considered weaker by all other mages despite their skill with the plane.</p>
