		<p>Knights are fighters experienced with the use of horse and lance, armour and authority. A knight often finds a career as a commander of guards or mercenaries, while some find their way into the guard forces of the highest nobility. Most knights care deeply about honour, although for many chivalry is considered an outdated, useless concept.</p>

		<p>There are very many kinds of knights on modern Amathereon. Some embrace change, while others actively fight against it. Some end up commanding great battles against the forces of Arakh, while others turn to serve him for their own personal gain. The one thing that all these knights have in common is power: a knight can build an army out of the peasantry of any nation, and rule like a king.</p>

		<h2>Heavy Armour</h2>

		<p>Knights receive 25% more bonuses from armour, and do not receive any dexterity penalty for wearing heavy armour.</p>

		<h2>Ability Score Bonuses</h2>

		<p>Warriors gain a +1 bonus to strength and resilience.</p>

		<p>Knights gain an additional +1 bonus to constitution.</p>
