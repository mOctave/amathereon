# Contributing to Evennia

There are many ways you can contribute to Evennia development:

 - You can help a lot by being active in the community. You can spread
   the word - by writing, talking, blogging etc about Evennia. Let
   others know text-based gaming is still a thing!
 - You can help by reporting any issues/bugs you find, and tell us of your
   feature requests [as an issue on github][issues]. This is also where you
   report typos or errors in the [the Evennia documentation][docs].
 - To help fixing (or expand) our docs, check out [how to contribute to docs][contribute-docs].
 - To contribute to Evennia itself, check out how to [help with code][helping-code].
