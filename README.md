# Amathereon

Amathereon is a MUD in a traditional fantasy setting. The plane of Entropy is rolling into the plane of Reality, and with it chaos is sweeping the world. Fight the chaos, or support it: it's your choice!

# Playing

To play Amathereon, clone the repository. Then, if you have a MUD client, point it to `localhost:4000` or `127.0.0.1:4000`. Otherwise, go to `localhost:4001/webclient/` or `127.0.0.1:4001/webclient/`. Using a MUD client is recommended, as the web client requires access to the jQuery server, which is occasionally down. The reccomended character encoding is UTF-8.
