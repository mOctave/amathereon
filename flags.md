# Flag Listing

Amathereon uses flags, attached to rooms, as a way to add flavour and various capabilities to those rooms. Here they are, in a list.

## Mechanical Flags

- **shop**: You can buy and sell stuff here.
- **outdoors**: This room is located outdoors, and so it gets dark at night unless it is also *lit*.
- **lit**: This room is lit and never becomes dark. Rooms that are not outdoors are always lit by default.
- **semilit**: This room is dimly lit, and never becomes fully dark.
- **unlit**: This room is always dark, even in the daytime.
- **safe**: You cannot harm another character in this room.

## Flags Affecting Echoes

- **outdoors**: This room is located outdoors, and is not sheltered from the elements.
- **forest**: This room is a forest.
- **street**: This room is a busy street in a city or town.
- **urban**: This room is located in some relatively large municipality.
