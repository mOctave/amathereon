# Omnipolis

## Omnipolis Square

You stand in the centre of a bustling stone plaza. Around you, people hurry to wherever they have to go, listen to some street musicians that have set up near the fountain, or just relax. This square is also the end of the highway known as Grey Road, which leads west from here through the city gates and onwards to towns like Dravenmove, Pearlder, and Amhand.
