# Omnipolis

## Omnipolis Square

You stand in the centre of a bustling stone plaza. Around you, people hurry to wherever they have to go, listen to some street musicians that have set up near the fountain, or just relax. This square is also the end of the highway known as Grey Road, which leads west from here through the city gates and onwards to towns like Dravenmove, Pearlder, and Amhand.

## Omnipolis City Guardhouse

The Omnipolis City Guardhouse is a sprawling complex, complete with training facilities, offices, and a public armoury. It is well but simply constructed, and you have the feeling that you are constantly being watched. To the southwest is Omnipolis Square, while there is a doorway to the connected armoury to the north and some private guardrooms to the east.

## Omnipolis City Armoury

The Omnipolis City Armoury is a public armoury run on the premise that if all citizens carry weapons around, then at least people have a chance against cutpurses and rogues. Interestingly enough, the program seems to work, and so the armoury remains open. To your west is an exit onto Raven Street, there's a practice field to your east for sparring, and the Omnipolis City Guardhouse continues to the north and south.

## Royal Tailor's Shop

This large shop that opens onto Ominpolis Square is the most profitable enterprise of its kind in all of Omnipolis, made especially grand by the royal seal that is proudly displayed in the front window. Bolts of cloth hang from racks all over the room, and fine and ordinary clothes alike are displayed throughout. Upstairs is a space for the tailors to work, and Omnipolis Square is to the southeast. To the east is a second entrance onto Raven Street.

## Raven Street

Raven Street is a large street that carves a straight path north from Omnipolis Square. To either side are large shopfronts and the city houses of rich lords. At regular intervals, you pass gutterspouts in the shape of ravens, the namesake of this road.
